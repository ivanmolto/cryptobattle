# CRYPTO BATTLE

Solana APIs are Fun!
A casual game for Solana nerds. Are you ready for a battle against any hash account?
No need to connect any wallet.

- Fast, open and free: Lightning fast Solana on-chain data. Open and free forever.
- Surfacing the Signal: Profiling transactions, domains, and subdomains.
- Discovering opportunities in a friendly way: Performing due diligence while having fun in the Solana ecosystem.

A challenge sponsore by [SolanaFM](https://solana.fm)
Made for the [Encode x Solana Hackathon](https://www.encode.club/encodesolanahack) sponsored by the [Solana Foundation](https://solana.org/).

## Game Instructions

- Enter a Solana account hash for each player and submit.
  Each player is an instance and we will get the points count for each instance.
  The points are the sum of the number the transactions, domains, subdomains, and favourite domains.

- Click the Battle button and

- Check the results: the winner and the loser or just a tie. The winner is the player with more points.

You can also check the latest transactions for each player (instance).

## SolanaFM APIs

The SolanaFM APIs are free of charge but usages are gated by a rate-limiting middleware.
But to increase the rate limits we have generated our own `API Keys` to authenticate each request.

The API keys carry many privilegees, so be sure to keep them secured!
Do Your Own Research.
Do not share, do not save in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code ðŸ˜‰, and so forth.
The APIs are used here only for having fun while participation in the hackathon.

## What are Bonfida Domains

Solana domains are a feature in the Solana blockchain that provides a human-readale way of identifying resources in the network. Instead of using complex addresses, users can register and use domain names to represent their accounts, contracts, or services. This simplifies the process of sending transactions, accessing decentralised applications, and sharing information on the Solana network.
